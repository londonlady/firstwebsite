  <p> After living across the globe, I havr found a passion for solving probems
     and creating change. I love to find places where I can apply this, and explore
   interesting new fields </p>
   <p> These are a few of my favorite projects </p>

  <button class="accordion">Spotlight on a Scientist</button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>I run the blog <a href="https://spotlightonascientist.com"> Spotlight
    on a Scientist </a> to empower young women to pursue STEM. Many girls lose
    interest in STEM as they feel like outsiders, to combat this, I profile
    and showcase diverse women working in <em>all</em> aspects of STEM. I have also
    partnered with non profit, Science Club for Girls, to further spread
    this message.</p>

  <button class="accordion"> Team Scoot</button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>During a hackathon, my team had the idea for a scooter share scheme.
     After winning some seed money, I drove the project forwards, iterating
     from a sketch to a elegant and reasonable prototype. Despite widespread
     student and faculty support, the grant to bring Team Scoot to life was
     blocked by the schoolâ€™s legal team</p>

  <button class="accordion">PAMUN 2018</button>
  <div class="panel">
  <p>I am leading organization for a 150+ person Model United Nations
    conference. This involves sending emails, updating a website, writing
    background guides and running crisis room for both a joint cabinet crisis
    and specialized committee.</p>
